      <p class="intro">It's good to be kind and nice to people </p>
      <p>I love to see other people happy and giving hope to those who feel like giving up.</em>
        <p>What you give is what you get back,what you sower is what you ripe,that's some of the principles of life.</p>
        <p>You can't be hateful and expect love,you can't be arrogant and expect favour,it's a two way traffic thing.
        </p>
        <p>Some people live because of that smile,love and kindness they receive from us ,even that strange on the road
        </p>
        <p>can be kept alive by that smile and kindness we show them when we meet.</p>
        <p>It's good to be sensitive on how we treat our fellow being,be it at the workplace,home,at the mall,stores
          etc,</p>
      </p>be nice to that cleaner,garbage collector,spouses,kids anybody we meet or live with them.</p>
      <p id="last">People have their own struggle,they have people and circumstances against them in their life,they only need a
        kind person for them to servive.</p>
