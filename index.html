<title>Story of my life!</title>
<h1>My Website</h1>
<p>It's good to be  kind and nice to people </p>
<p>I love to see other people happy and giving hope to those who feel like giving up.</em>
<p>What you give is what you get back,what you sower is what you ripe,that's some of the principles of life.</p>
<p>You can't be hateful and expect love,you can't be arrogant and expect favour,it's a two  way traffic thing.</p>
<p>Some people live because of that smile,love and kindness they receive from us ,even that strange on the road</p>
<p>can be kept alive by that smile and kindness we show them when we meet.</p>
<p>It's good to be sensitive on how we treat our fellow being,be it at the workplace,home,at the mall,stores etc,</p>
</p>be nice to that cleaner,garbage collector,spouses,kids anybody we meet or live with them.</p>
<p>People have their own struggle,they have people and circumstances against them in their life,they only need a kind person for them to servive.</p>
